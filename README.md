# Movie Recommendation System using LightFM

## Introduction
A movie recommendation system aims to predict user preferences for movies based on their behavior and historical data. LightFM is a Python library that provides collaborative filtering and hybrid recommendation algorithms. In this project, we'll build a simple movie recommendation system using LightFM.

## Filtration Strategies
1. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Collaborative filtering uses the behavior of a group of users to make recommendations for other users. It's based on the idea that users who have similar preferences will like similar items.
   - There are two types of collaborative models:
     - **Memory-based methods**: These techniques are simple to implement and provide easy-to-explain recommendations. They use user-item interaction data to find similar users or items.
     - **Model-based methods**: These methods create a model that learns from the data and predicts user preferences. LightFM falls into this category.
2. **Content-based Filtering**:
   - Content-based filtering recommends items based on their features. For movies, this means considering attributes like genre, lead actors, directors, etc.
   - For example, if a user likes movies such as "The Prestige," we can recommend similar movies based on shared features (e.g., lead actors, genre, director).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collect data from the Movies Dataset on Kaggle.
   - Preprocess the data (cleaning, feature extraction, etc.).

2. **Model Training with LightFM**:
   - Install LightFM using `pip install lightfm`.
   - Train a hybrid content-based + collaborative algorithm using the WARP loss function.
   - The hybrid model combines user-item interactions and item features (content-based).

3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Once the model is trained, you can generate recommendations for users.
   - Print out recommended movies for specific users from your dataset.
